Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2)

Acceptance

By using the software, you agree to all of the terms and conditions below.

Copyright License

The licensor grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, 
royalty-free, worldwide, limited license to use, copy, distribute, make available, 
and prepare derivative works of the software, in each case subject to the limitations 
and conditions below.

Limitations

You may not provide the software to third parties as a hosted or managed service, 
where the service provides users with access to any substantial set of the features 
or functionality of the software.

For example, you may not provide a service where users can upload, access, 
process, or retrieve data using the software, or otherwise make the software 
available over a network where it is hosted by you or by a third party on your 
behalf, unless you have obtained a license to do so from the licensor.

The foregoing does not apply to any patch or update to the software that the 
licensor makes generally available for free.

You may not move, change, disable, or circumvent the license key functionality 
in the software, nor remove or obscure any functionality in the software that 
is protected by license keys.

You may not remove or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices 
contained in the software.

Patents

The licensor grants you a license, under any patent claims the licensor owns 
or controls, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and have 
imported the software, in each case subject to the limitations and conditions 
set forth in this license. This license does not cover any patent claims that 
are infringed by modifications or additions to the software. If you make any 
such modifications or additions, you must obtain a separate license from the 
licensor to use the software.

If you initiate patent litigation against any entity alleging that the software 
infringes patent claims, then your rights under this license from the licensor 
to the software shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

Notices

You must include a copy of this license with the software or, if you provide the 
software as a hosted or managed service, with any user documentation.

You must include, on any copies of the software that you distribute, 
a notice stating: “This software is licensed under the Elastic License v2.”

No Other Rights

The licensor reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this license.

Compliance

If you violate any term of this license, your rights under this license will 
terminate automatically. If the licensor provides you with notice of your 
violation and you cure the violation within 30 days of receiving the notice, 
then your rights under this license will be reinstated retroactively. However, 
if you violate this license again, this license will terminate automatically 
and permanently.

No Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT 
THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR THAT ANY ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED.

Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA, OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, HOWEVER 
CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, 
OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE), ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE 
OF THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

Trademarks

This license does not grant you any right in the trademarks, service marks, 
brand names, or logos of the licensor.
